# Personal Profile

Greetings to all the colleagues in the computer science field!

My name is **Ling Gao** (KaiXiu Gao), an undergraduate student from the Hunan Institute of Science and Technology. I am currently serving as an independent advisor in the Microsoft community, responsible for user support for Microsoft's pillar products such as Windows and Office. Meanwhile, I am also a loyal Microsoft Insider who has long been involved in Windows systems' software testing.

I have achieved excellent results in numerous aspects of my work. I have provided technical support to over **8,400** Microsoft product users, and my customer satisfaction (CSAT) has remained above **98%** throughout the year. Meanwhile, I have provided almost **650** feedback for Microsoft's products, including Windows and Edge, and ranked in the **Top 10** of the global Windows Insider ranking multiple times, making substantial contributions to Microsoft products' vigorous development.

Going forward in 2020, I will focus my work on **"cultivating more Windows Insider talents for Microsoft."** I plan to compile two e-books that elaborate on the knowledge and experiences I have learned from the theoretical and practical levels to Windows Insiders. I firmly believe that with the close collaboration of all Microsoft employees, product enthusiasts, and volunteers, Microsoft will someday succeed in achieving the great mission of **"empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."**

Thank you sincerely for reading!
